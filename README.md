# Hacktoberfest-2021

#### Hunter Library Seat Reservations

A backend that interfaces with texts through Twilio. Keep track of which
seats in the library are taken up and which ones are free. 

An opensource project for Hunter's 2021 Hacktober. 

## FEATURES
- Text a phone number which seat you're about to use
- Our servers update the current state of all the library seats
- Text that same number for a response on which seats are currently available


NOTE: We're prioritizing pull requests from Hunter students, then the greater
CUNY community, and then outside pull requests. The purpose of this project is to 
introduce open source programming concepts, version control, and foster the Hunter 
CS Community.
